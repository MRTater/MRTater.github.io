about_me: "I am a Ph.D. student in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, supervised by <a href='https://yunyasong.github.io/'>Prof. Yunya Song</a> and <a href='https://anyirao.com/'>Prof. Prof. Anyi Rao</a>. As a Researcher, I specialize in advancing LLMs across diverse domains, including enhancing reasoning capabilities and improving generation quality. Prior to joining Huawei, I worked as an independent researcher with a focus on the intersection of NLP and 3D generation. Additionally, I have expertise in AI security, particularly in areas like LLM watermarking and steganography."
